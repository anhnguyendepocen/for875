## Learning objectives
  + practice using Rcpp to run a C++ function through R
  + use `microbenchmark()` to compare function performance
  
## Overview
Modify this R Markdown file by filling in the code needed to answer the questions.

## Submission instructions
Upload your exercise_Rcpp.Rmd and exercise_Rcpp.html files to the Rcpp Exercise D2L dropbox. 

## Grading
You will receive full credit if your R Markdown document: 1) compiles without error; and 2) correctly completes the `# TODO:` code chunks. Also, please, fill in the feedback [questions](#questions) at the end of the exercise. 

## Getting started
Again, set some global options to make the R code printed in the HTML output look nice.

```{r global_options}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = NA, tidy = TRUE)
```

## Part 1: Function writing
Use `cppFunction()` to write versions of the following functions from R's `base` package into C++. Assume no values are missing. Make sure you test your functions. The outputs of your C++ functions should be the same format as the outputs of the R functions in the example runs.

*  `all` - Given a logical vectors, are all of the values true? Return `TRUE` or `FALSE`. Write `allC`.
*  `range` - Return a 2-item vector containing the minimum and maximum of a numeric vector. Write `rangeC`. 

*Note*: C++ does have a `max()` function, but it is only for pairwise maximum (two arguments), not vector maximum element. Think about how you can iterate through a vector to find the max and min values. (*Hint*: Look at the textbook's **Vector input and scalar output** section code for a loop example.)

```{r}
# TODO 15.1: Rewrite all() as allC()

# Example run 1
all(c(T,T,F,T,T,T,F,F,F))

# Example run 2
all(c(T,T,T,T,T,T))
```

```{r}
# TODO 15.2: Rewrite range() as rangeC()

# Example run 1
range(c(-0.654, 0.121, 0.088, 0.976, -0.325))

# Example run 2
range(c(1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1))

# Example run 3
range(c(9991, 847, 63, 345, 561))
```

How does the efficiency of your function, `rangeC`, compare to the R function `range`? Uncomment the code below and answer the `## TODO:` question.

```{r}
# library(microbenchmark)

# x <- runif(10000) # generate points from uniform distribution
# microbenchmark(range(x), rangeC(x))
```

```{r}
## TODO 15.3: What do you notice about the running times of the two programs?

# Answer here...
```

## Part 2: Matrix input, matrix output

Below I wrote a R function called `distR()` that computes the inter-site Euclidean distance matrix for points defined in a n-by-p matrix, where n is the number of sites and columns define the coordinate values in p-dimensional space. Your task is to rewrite my `distR()` function using a Rcpp `cppFunction()` function called `distC()`. Then give the timings of the two functions, i.e., distR() and distC(), using `microbenchmark()`. Choose test cases that convince you that your Rcpp function is more efficient.

```{r}
distR <- function(x){
 
  n <- nrow(x)
  p <- ncol(x)
  out <- matrix(0, n, n)
  
  for(i in 1:n){
    for(j in 1:n){
      for(k in 1:p){
        out[i,j] <- out[i,j] + (x[i,k] - x[j,k])^2
      }
      out[i,j] <- sqrt(out[i,j])
    } 
  }
  
  out
}

##Example run
x <- cbind(1:3, 1:3)
distR(x)
```

```{r}
# TODO 15.4: Rewrite distR() using a Rcpp cppFunction() function, distC()

```

```{r}
# TODO 15.5: Give the timings of the two functions using microbenchmark()

```
