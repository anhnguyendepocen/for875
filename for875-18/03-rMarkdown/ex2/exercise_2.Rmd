## Learning objectives
  + practice working within RStudio
  + create a R Markdown document and resulting html document in RStudio
  + calculate descriptive statistics and graphics 

## Overview
Create a R Markdown document that recreates the archetype html document available [here](http://blue.for.msu.edu/FOR875/data/exercise_2_archetype.html). Your resulting HTML document should be different from the archetype document in two ways: 

  1. replace my name with your name at the top of the document
  2. add answers to the four questions in Part 2.

The Exercise 2 video provides some guidance for completing this exercise.

## Submission instructions
Upload your exercise_2.Rmd and exercise_2.html files to the Exercise 2 D2L dropbox. 

## Grading
You will receive full credit if the html document produced from your R Markdown document matches the [archetype](http://blue.for.msu.edu/FOR875/data/exercise_2_archetype.html) document (with the two differences noted above).

## Some tips
Consult the R Markdown [authoring basics](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html), [R Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf), and [R Markdown Reference](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf), along with Chapter 3 in the course book.
