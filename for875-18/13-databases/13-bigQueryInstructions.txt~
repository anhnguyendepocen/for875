Steps to Open up a Google Cloud Platform for using Google BigQuery

1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/. Log into a google account or create one (unfortunately you will need to have a google account to access bigquery). 
2. Click on Select a project near the top left. Click on New Project. Name your project whatever you desire, set the location to No Location.
3. Create the new project
4. Wait a few seconds, then click on select a project and your new project should show up. 
5. In the Project info box, make note of your Project ID as you will need this for working in R. 
6. Click to the left of "Google Cloud Platform" to open up the side menu. Click on "APIs & Services", then "Dashboard" in the left menu
7. Click on “Enable Apis and Services” at the top of the page, then search for “BigQuery API” and “Cloud storage”. Then enable these APIs. 

You should now be all set to do all the queries we perform in Chapter 13.
