\chapter{Data}
Data science is a field that intersects with statistics, mathematics, computer science, and application areas such as marketing, biology, and physics. As such it is hard to formally define data science, but obviously data is central to data science, and it is useful at the start to consider some types of data that are of interest.

\section{Baby crawling data}
When thinking about data, we might initially have in mind a modest-sized and uncomplicated data set, most of which is made up of numbers. As an example of such a data set, a study was done to study the possible relationship between the age at which babies first begin to crawl and the temperature at the time of first crawling. Participants in the study were volunteers.\footnote{More correctly, were volunteered by their parents.} The data set from this study separates the babies by birth month, and reports the birth month, the average age (in weeks) when first crawling for that month, the standard deviation of the crawling ages for that month, the number of infants for that month, and the average temperature during the month when crawling commenced. The data are shown in Table~\ref{TABLE:CRAWLING} below.\footnote{These data were retrieved from \url{http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/DASL/Datafiles/Crawling.html}.}

{\ttfamily\noindent\bfseries\color{errorcolor}{\#\# Error in print(xtable(BabyCrawling, caption = "{}Data on age at crawling"{}, : could not find function "{}xtable"{}}}\end{kframe}
The size of this data set is relatively small, there are no missing observations, the variables are easily understood, etc.
