1. Add small exercises at the end of important sections. 
2. At the same time as the above, go through and make edits on the chapters.
2. Convert the envr2018 workshop stuff into a chapter
3. Make the databases chapter more accessible. Get rid of the google stuff, find a different example that can be used without having to make an account. 
4. Maybe add in a chapter for base plotting as opposed to ggplot.
5. Add some more Fourier to the signal processing chapter.
