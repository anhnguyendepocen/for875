# Data

Data science is a field that intersects with statistics, mathematics, computer science, and a wide range of applied fields, such as marketing, biology, and physics. As such, it is hard to formally define data science, but obviously data is central to data science, and it is useful at the start to consider some types of data that are of interest.
