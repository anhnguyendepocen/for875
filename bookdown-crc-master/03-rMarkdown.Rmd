# Scripts and R Markdown

Doing work in data science, whether for homework, a project for a business, or a research project, typically involves several iterations. For example creating an effective graphical representation of data can involve trying out several different graphical representations, and then tens if not hundreds of iterations when fine-tuning the chosen representation. Furthermore, each of these representations may require several R commands to create. Although this all could be accomplished by typing and re-typing commands at the R Console, it is easier and more effective to write the commands in a *script file*, which then can be submitted to the R console either a line at a time or all together.^[Unsurprisingly it is also possible to submit several selected lines of code at once.]
